# Reminder
Some of these files will not work without the base files from Hazard's Addons: Buildmode, etc.

In addition, please remember that these addons were made over the course of several years, and have altered significantly compared to their original state. They very well may not work in the presence of other community addons, and likely will not function properly unless loaded alongside other addons in this collection. We will provide zero official support, guidance, or troubleshooting to anyone that would like to use these addons, so please do so at your own risk.
